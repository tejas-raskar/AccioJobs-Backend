### ðŸš€ AccioJobs-Backend
AccioJobs-Backend is the backend service for the AccioJobs project. Its main objective is to fetch job listings from various APIs like Remotive and RemoteOK, as well as from various RSS feeds. The collected data is then combined and pushed to the database.

The `kestra.yaml` file contains the workflow that clones the scripts on a docker container, runs them and generates a `jobs.json` containing the newly fetched jobs. We iterate through the `jobs.json` and the DB to filter out 'new' jobs that are not already present in the database. This are stored in a `new_jobs.json`. 

We iterate through this `new_jobs.json` and check if any users prefered category matches with these jobs. If yes, we post the relevant jobs to the database from where the ML flow is triggered to create a personalised resume.

if any of these tasks fails, a slack message is posted to notify the developers.
